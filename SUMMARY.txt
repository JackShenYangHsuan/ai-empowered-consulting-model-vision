🎯 KEY FEATURES:

1. MAIN DASHBOARD
   • Central Orchestrator showing overall progress
   • Agent grid with real-time status cards
   • Create new agents with custom configurations

2. AGENT DETAIL VIEW (3-Panel Layout)
   • PLAN Panel: Step-by-step task breakdown with progress
   • DELIVERABLE Panel: Live preview of agent outputs
   • WORKING Panel: Chat interface to communicate with agents

3. ORCHESTRATOR VIEW
   • Synthesis plan tracking
   • Executive summary generation
   • Agent contributions table

4. AGENT CREATION MODAL
   • Choose agent type (Research, Financial, Strategy, etc.)
   • Define focus area and capabilities
   • Set priority and auto-sync options

🎨 DESIGN:

• Palantir-inspired dark theme (#0F1419 background)
• Professional color scheme (Blues, greens, yellows, reds)
• Fully responsive (Desktop → Tablet → Mobile)
• Smooth animations and interactions

🚀 HOW TO ACCESS:

Option 1: Direct
   Open: /Users/jackshen/Desktop/personal-website/command-center/index.html

Option 2: From Website
   Navigate to: https://jackshen.me/tinkering
   Click: "Command Center" card (newly added)

🎮 WHAT IT DOES (SIMULATED):

• Creates 3 sample agents on first load:
  - Market Research Agent (analyzing healthcare SaaS)
  - Financial Analyst (building DCF models)
  - Healthcare Expert (assessing regulations)

• Agents automatically progress through tasks every 3 seconds
• Real-time progress bars update
• Chat interface with auto-responses
• Activity logs stream in real-time
• Orchestrator synthesizes findings every 2 seconds
• Random blockers appear (realistic simulation)

💡 TRY THIS:

1. Open the app → Watch 3 agents working
2. Click any agent card → See detailed 3-panel view
3. Chat with agent: "Show me progress on all steps"
4. Click "+ New Agent" → Create your own custom agent
5. Click "View Summary" → See orchestrator synthesis

📊 SAMPLE AGENTS INCLUDED:

🔬 Market Research (85% → 100%)
