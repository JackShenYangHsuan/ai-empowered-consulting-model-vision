        "Nvidia's revenue grew from $3.54 billion in 2010 to an estimated $40 billion in 2024, exceeding 1,000% growth.",
        "AMD's revenue increased from $3.6 billion in 2010 to an estimated $9 billion in 2024, indicating much slower growth."
      ],
      "reasoning": "The evidence indicates that Nvidia's revenue growth significantly outpaces that of AMD, with Nvidia's revenue projected to grow from $3.54 billion in 2010 to an estimated $40 billion in 2024, representing a growth rate exceeding 1,000%. In contrast, AMD's revenue growth from $3.6 billion in 2010 to an estimated $9 billion in 2024 is much more modest. This supports the hypothesis that Nvidia grows at a rate much faster than AMD.",

      ],
      "reasoning": "While NVIDIA currently holds a dominant position in the GPU market and has shown significant revenue growth, the future of its dominance in the AI server market is uncertain due to the rapid growth of the market and potential competition. The projected growth of the AI server market suggests that new entrants or existing competitors could disrupt NVIDIA's current market share. More information on competitive dynamics and NVIDIA's strategic responses would be needed to draw a definitive conclusion.",
